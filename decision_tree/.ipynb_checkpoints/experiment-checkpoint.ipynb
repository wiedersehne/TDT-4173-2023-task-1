    "For this problem, you will be implementing a Decision Tree classifier that works on discrete (categorical) features. Although a relatively simple learning algorithm, the Decision Tree is often used as a fundamental building block for more powerful (and popular) models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosted ensembles. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should base your solution on the [ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithmhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) algorithm. This is a basic tree-learning algorithm that greedly grows a tree based on _information gain_ (reduction in entropy). Please refer to Chapter 3 of _Machine Learning_ by Tom M. Mitchell for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some skeleton code for the classifier, along with a couple of utility functions in the [decision_tree.py](./decision_tree.py) module. Please fill out the functions marked with `TODO` and feel free to add extra constructor arguments as you see fit (just make sure the default constructor solves the first dataset).\n"
